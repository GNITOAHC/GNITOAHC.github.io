# Lesson1-CommandLine(Linux)

A command-line interpreter or command-line processor uses a command-line interface (CLI) to receive  
commands from a user in the form of lines of text.
Command line is a line of text like `pwd`, `ls` which provide a certain meaning.  
A shell will interpret the command and response.

## Shell

The shell is the thing that runs on the other end of the pipes or the communications channel that is connected to the terminal.  
The shell is responsible for receiving your keystrokes, understanding what your keystrokes mean, performing some work, and sending text out to be displayed.

## Opening a command-line application

Application :

- Windows : WSL(Windows Subsystem for Linux)
- MacOS or Linux : Terminal

## Basic concept

### Prompt

Prompt is a character which give you a hint that the command start here. Mostly, you will get somthing like

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
    return 0;
}
```

or

```powershell
>
```

### Start from something simple

```powershell
$ whoami
```

After pressing <enter>, the app will gave a response like:

```bash
$ whoami
beethoven # test
```

## Basic command line

1. whoami, print effective user name.

   ```shell
   > whoami
   beethoven   # User name
   ```

2. man, format and display the on-line manual page.

   ```shell
   > man whoami
   WHOAMI(1)           General Commands Manual
   NAME
       whoami - display effective user id.

   SYNOPOSIS
       whoami

   DESCRIPTION
       ...(there are more)
   ```

3. See options in appendix A

4. clear, clear the terminal screen.  
   options:
   ```shell
   > clear       # Clear the terminal screen.
   > clear -x    # Do not clear the scroll history.
   ```
5. pwd, print the current working directory.

   ```shell
   > pwd
   /Users/beethoven/Documents/test
   ```

6. ls, list the files under current working directory.

   ```shell
   > ls
   README.md   init.lua    slides
   > ls -a     # list everything includeing implicit files.
   .   ..  .local  README.md   init.lua    slides
   ```

   `ls` can alse list other directory's file by adding destination after `ls`.

   ```shell
   > ls
   README.md   init.lua    slides
   > ls slides
   slides1.pdf    slides2.pdf
   ```

7. cd, change the current working directory.
   `.` means currrent directory while `..` represents the parent directory.

   ```shell
   > pwd
   /Users/beethoven/Documents/test
   > cd ..     # Go to parent directory.
   > pwd
   /Users/beethoven/Documents
   > ls -a     # List everything including implicit files.
   .   ..  .local  test    slides
   > cd test   # Go to 'test' directory.
   > pwd
   /Users/beethoven/Documents/test
   ```

   Use `cd [dir]/[dir]` can move more level a time.

8. mkdir, create a new directory.
   Mostly, a directory will be bold when displaying and a file won't.
   ```shell
   > ls    # List
   test    slides
   > mkdir code
   > ls
   test    slides    code
   ```
9. touch, create a file
   ```shell
   > ls    # List
   test    slides   code
   > touch main.cpp
   > ls
   test    slides   code    main.cpp
   ```
10. rm, delete
    ```shell
    > ls
    test    slides    code    main.cpp
    > rm main.cpp
    > ls
    test    slides    code
    ```
    options:
    ```shell
    > rm [file]
    > rm -r [dir]
    > rm -i [file]
    > rm -f [file]
    ```
11. cp, copy
    ```shell
    > cp [file] [newname]
    > cp [file] [destination]
    ```
12. mv, move or rename
    ```shell
    > mv [file] [newname]         # Rename the file foem `file` to `newname`.
    > mv [file] [destination]
    ```
13. open/xdg-open, open a file or directory with default application outside the terminal.  
    `open` works on MacOS and `xdg-open` works on linux and wsl.
    ```shell
    > open test.txt     # On mac
    > xdg-open test.txt # On Linux or WSL
    ```
14. date, display the current time
    `man date` to see more options, we won't get into this cause it won't be used very frequently.
    ```shell
    > date
    Fri 8 July 2022 15:09:28 CST
    ```
15. cat, concatenate files and print on the standard output
    For example, if a file `date.txt`'s contents are `Hello, world!`.
    ```shell
    > cat date.txt
    Hello, world!
    ```
16. See redirecting output in appendix B

17. echo, print whatever value you pass in.
    ```shell
    > echo "Hello!"
    Hello!
    > echo $PATH    # print some variables default in your terminal
    /opt/homebrew/bin:/opt/homebrew/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin
    > echo "USERNAME=Beethoven" > name.txt    # echo something into a file
    > cat name.txt
    USERNAME=Beethoven
    ```
18. find, traverse a directory and find what you're finding
    `find` is a powerful tool but with a lot of options, we will just go through the most-used command.  
    For more info, see `man find`.
    ```shell
    find [dir] -name [pattern]    # search for file e.g. `find /Downloads -name main.cpp`
    find [dir] -type d            # search for directory under this directory
    find [dir] -type f            # search for regualr file under this directory
    find [dir] -type l            # search for symbolic link under this directory
    ```
19. grep, file pattern searcher
    `grep` too, we will just go through the most-used, for more info, see `man grep`.
    ```shell
    grep [search_pattern] [file]
    grep -r [search_pattern] [dir]
    grep -i [search_pattern] [file]
    ```
20. sudo, execute the command with the security privileges of the superuser
    ```shell
    sudo [command]    # execute command with security privileges
    ```

## Appendix

### Appendix A : Options

When running `man [command]`, you will see a `SYNOPSIS`, like :

```shell
> man clear
echo(1)          General Commands Manual          echo(1)

NAME
     echo â€“ write arguments to the standard output

SYNOPSIS
     echo [-n] [string ...]

DESCRIPTION-n
        (...)
        -n      Do not print the trailing newline character.
        (...)

SEE ALSO
        (...)
```

The `SYNOPSIS` part is the options of the command you could add, and the description will give you more detail about the corresponding options.

### Appendix B : Redirecting output

`A > B` or `A >> B` will redirect the output from A to B,  
while `A > B` will replace substitute B to A and `A >> B` will append B with A.

```shell
> date
Fri 8 July 2022 15:09:28 CST
> cat test.txt    # See what is inside test.txt, while nothing is inside so show nothing now.
> date > test.txt    # Nothing show cause the output is redirected to test.txt
> cat test.txt    # Now test.txt has the output of date
Fri 8 July 2022 15:09:28 CST
> echo "Hello, world!" >> test.txt
> cat test.txt    # Now test.txt was appended by "Hello, world!"
Fri 8 July 2022 15:09:28 CST
Hello, world!
> echo "HAHA!" > test.txt
> cat test.txt    # Now test.txt was substituted by "HAHA!"
HAHA!
```

### Appendix C : Expansions

1. `*` and `?`
   ```shell
   > ls *.cpp    # List files only end with '.cpp' [* will match everything]
   main.cpp    test.cpp    hello.cpp
   > ls *.???    # ??? will match any three characters in a roll
   main.cpp    test.cpp    hello.cpp   test.vim    init.lua
   > rm *.???
   ```
2. `{}`
   ```shell
   > echo {a, b, c}
   a  b  c
   > echo {a, b, c}.txt
   a.txt    b.txt    c.txt
   > touch {a, b, c}.txt
   > ls
   a.txt    b.txt    c.txt
   > touch app.{js, html, css, py}
   > ls
   a.txt    b.txt    c.txt
   app.js   app.html app.css  app.py
   > ls app.*
   app.js   app.html app.css  app.py
   > echo Day{1..5}
   Day1 Day2 Day3 Day4 Day5
   ```

### Appendix D : Piping

Before introducing piping, first we need to know a new command `wc`(word count).

```shell
wc [file]       # List out number of line, word, byte
wc -w [file]    # Number of words only
wc -l [file]    # Number of line only
wc -c [file]    # Number of bytes only
```

Example :

```shell
> cat test.txt
Hello World
This is test.txt
> wc test.txt
       2       5      29 test.txt      # line, word, number of byte, file name
> wc -w test.txt                       # number of word
       5 test.txt
```

Now, we can dive into piping.
Piping is taking standard output from the pipe character's(|) left and make
it standard input of the command on it's right.  
For instance, `echo "Hello World" | wc -w`, this command take `echo`'s
standard output and make is `wc`'s standard input.

```shell
> echo "Hello World" | wc -w
       2       # It's 2 cause "Hello World" is two words
```

Piping can do more than this, like

```powershell
> cat test.txt | grep "function"
> cat test.txt | less
```
